/**
 * This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any non-null object can be 
 * used as a key or as a value. Hashtable is similar to HashMap except it is synchronized. 
 * There are few more differences between HashMap and Hashtable class, you can read them 
 * in detail at: Difference between HashMap and Hashtable.

 * In this tutorial we will see how to create a Hashtable, how to populate its entries 
 * and then we will learn how to display its key-value pairs using Enumeration. At the end 
 * of this article we will see Hashtable tutorials and methods of Hashtable class.
