	/**What is the Difference between HashMap and Hashtable? 
	 * This is one of the frequently asked interview questions for Java/J2EE professionals. 
	 * HashMap and Hashtable both classes implements java.util.Map interface, however there 
	 * are differences in the way they work and their usage. 
	 * Here we will discuss the differences between these classes.
	 *1) HashMap is non-synchronized. This means if it’s used in multithread environment then 
	 *	 more than one thread can access and process the HashMap simultaneously. 
	 * Hashtable is synchronized. It ensures that no more than one thread can access the Hashtable 
	 * at a given moment of time. The thread which works on Hashtable acquires a lock on it 
	 * to make the other threads wait till its work gets completed.
	 *
	 *2) HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.Hashtable doesn’t allow null
	 * keys and null values.
	 *3) HashMap implementation LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order and TreeMap sorts the 
	 * mappings based on the ascending order of keys.
	 *Hashtable doesn’t guarantee any kind of order. It doesn’t maintain the mappings in any 
	 *particular order
	 *4) Initially Hashtable was not the part of collection framework it has been made 
	 *a collection framework member later after being retrofitted to implement the Map interface.
	 *HashMap implements Map interface and is a part of collection framework since the beginning.
	 *5) Another difference between these classes is that the Iterator of the HashMap is a 
	 *fail-fast and it throws ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies 
	 *the map structurally by adding or removing any element except iterator’s own remove() 
	 *method. In Simple words fail-fast means: When calling iterator.next(), if any 
	 *modification has been made between the moment the iterator was created and the 
	 *moment next() is called, a ConcurrentModificationException is immediately thrown.
	 *Enumerator for the Hashtable is not fail-fast.
	 *
	 *When to use HashMap and Hashtable?
		1) As stated above the main difference between HashMap & Hashtable is synchronization. 
		If there is a need of thread-safe operation then Hashtable can be used as all its 
		methods are synchronized but it’s a legacy class and should be avoided as there 
		is nothing about it, which cannot be done by HashMap. For multi-thread environment 
		I would recommend you to use ConcurrentHashMap (Almost similar to Hashtable) or 
		even you can make the HashMap synchronized explicitly
	 *2) Synchronized operation gives poor performance so it should be avoided until unless 
	 *required. Hence for non-thread environment HashMap should be used without any doubt.
